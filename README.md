# MyGitProject

## Project Description
This project demonstrates collaborative coding using GitHub. The goal is to practice
basic version control concepts such as repositories, branches, commits, pull requests,
and merging while working as a group.

## Problem Definition
The project is a simple Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic
operations. Each operation is implemented in a separate Python file to support
collaborative development.

## Group Members and Roles
Raiyan (Person 1):
- Created the GitHub repository
- Set up the README file
- Managed the main branch and merged pull requests

Shath (Person 2):
- Created a feature branch
- Implemented a separate arithmetic operation
- Submitted a pull request for review and merging

## Contributions
Raiyan worked on repository setup, documentation, and integration of changes.
Shath worked independently on a feature branch and contributed new functionality
to the project through a pull request.
